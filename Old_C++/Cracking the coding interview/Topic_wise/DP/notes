How to do Memoization?

1. Write a recursive solution:
    Visualise the problem as a tree
    Shrink the problem into sub-problems
    Implement the tree using recursive: 
        Leaves : base case
    Test the code for small inputs

2. Make it efficient 
    Add a memo object: 
        Keys: args to the function
        Values: return values
    Memo object should be shared among all recursive calls
    Add a new base case to return memo object
    Implement memo storage: Before returning, store the result in memo.
